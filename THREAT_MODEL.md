# COINSCIOUS Platform - Threat Model

## üéØ Executive Summary

This document outlines the top 5 security risks for the COINSCIOUS platform, their mitigations, and residual risks. The platform implements defense-in-depth strategies to protect against both technical and operational threats.

## üö® Top 5 Security Risks

### 1. **Private Key Compromise**
**Risk Level**: CRITICAL  
**Impact**: Complete system takeover, fund theft, compliance violations

**Description**: If private keys are compromised, attackers can:
- Pause/unpause the system
- Mint unlimited tokens
- Transfer all funds
- Modify compliance settings
- Execute emergency functions

**Mitigations**:
- **Multisig Protection**: All critical functions require 2-of-N multisig approval
- **Hardware Security**: Private keys stored in hardware security modules (HSMs)
- **Key Rotation**: Automated 90-day key rotation with secure handover
- **Access Controls**: Role-based access with time-limited permissions
- **Monitoring**: Real-time alerts for unusual key usage patterns

**Residual Risk**: MEDIUM - Sophisticated attackers with physical access to HSMs could potentially compromise keys

### 2. **Smart Contract Vulnerabilities**
**Risk Level**: HIGH  
**Impact**: Fund loss, compliance violations, system manipulation

**Description**: Vulnerabilities in smart contracts could allow:
- Reentrancy attacks
- Integer overflow/underflow
- Access control bypass
- Logic errors in compliance checks

**Mitigations**:
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 100% test coverage with fuzz testing
- **Security Audits**: Regular third-party security audits
- **Static Analysis**: Automated Slither analysis in CI/CD
- **Formal Verification**: Mathematical proofs for critical functions
- **Upgradeable Architecture**: Ability to patch vulnerabilities quickly

**Residual Risk**: LOW - Extensive testing and audits minimize but cannot eliminate all vulnerabilities

### 3. **Compliance Bypass**
**Risk Level**: HIGH  
**Impact**: Regulatory violations, legal liability, platform shutdown

**Description**: Attackers could bypass compliance checks to:
- Transfer tokens to unauthorized parties
- Mint tokens without proper accreditation
- Distribute payouts to non-compliant recipients

**Mitigations**:
- **Multi-Layer Validation**: Compliance checks at multiple levels
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Continuous compliance status verification
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all compliance decisions
- **Automated Alerts**: Immediate notification of compliance violations
- **Regular Audits**: Periodic review of compliance logic

**Residual Risk**: MEDIUM - Complex compliance rules may have edge cases

### 4. **Frontend/API Attacks**
**Risk Level**: MEDIUM  
**Impact**: Unauthorized operations, data theft, system manipulation

**Description**: Attacks on the operator console or API could:
- Execute unauthorized transactions
- Bypass two-operator approval
- Access sensitive compliance data
- Manipulate preflight simulations

**Mitigations**:
- **Authentication**: Multi-factor authentication for all operators
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control with principle of least privilege
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation of all user inputs
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against brute force and DoS attacks
- **HTTPS/TLS**: End-to-end encryption for all communications

**Residual Risk**: LOW - Strong authentication and authorization controls

### 5. **Insider Threats**
**Risk Level**: MEDIUM  
**Impact**: Unauthorized operations, data theft, compliance violations

**Description**: Malicious insiders could:
- Execute unauthorized transactions
- Bypass compliance controls
- Access sensitive data
- Manipulate audit logs

**Mitigations**:
- **Two-Operator Approval**: All critical operations require two operators
- **Audit Logging**: Complete audit trail of all actions
- **Access Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring of user activities
- **Background Checks**: Thorough vetting of all personnel
- **Separation of Duties**: No single person can execute critical operations

**Residual Risk**: MEDIUM - Collusion between operators could bypass controls
